Basic space shooter using ncurses.

####Status
:large_orange_diamond: : under development.

On the master branh should always be a playable version of the game.


####Usange
Use **J** for going UP and **K** for going DOWN

Use **A** to shoot a red misil, **S** to shoot a blue one and **D** to shoot a green one.

Enemies are three different colors and can only be destroyed if you shoot them whit a misil with the same color that the enemy.

####Compilation
To compile you should have ncurses, on Debian-like systems use:

`# apt-get install ncurses-devel ncurses`

Then run `make` and you are ready to go.
